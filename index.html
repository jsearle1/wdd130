                <p>Hello! My name is Jordan Searle and I am from Plain City, Utah. I am a CNC Machinist for a company called Blue Sun Manufacturing. 
                    My goal is to become a Manufacturing Engineer. I currently work as the Lead for the swing-shift.
                    I enjoy spending my freetime either playing video games, making stuff on my 3D printer, or developing a personal video game with my brother. 
                    My favorite video game to play is definatley "The Legend of Zelda". The video game that my brother and I are developing is based on the Mario and Luigi Series, but mixed with the style of Paper Mario.
                    Another hobby that I have is reading books. My favorite book series is called "Ranger's Apprentice" by John Flanagan. 
                    The current book series that I am reading is called "The Stormlight Archieves" by Brandon Sanderson. 
                    I also enjoy programing and am excited to learn in this web development class! It is a personal goal of mine to learn as much as I can so that I might be able to be a jack-of-all-trades. 
                    I also feel it to be a special privilage that I get to have this class with my brother as well. 
                </p>

                <p>I live in the state of Utah. I find the view of the mountains here to be quite stunning.
                    The snow we get here make for wonderful skiing. Outside of winter, it gets nice and warm too. 
                    One thing that we were famous for was the placing of the Golden Spike for the railroad which was where the tracks from one end of the country to the other were tied together.
                    One more thing about Utah is that we have five national monuments.</p>

            <p>Hello! My name is Jordan Searle and I am from Plain City, Utah. I am a CNC Machinist for a company called Torq Manufacturing. 
                My goal is to become a Manufacturing Engineer. I enjoy spending my freetime either playing video games, making stuff on my 3D printer, or developing a personal video game with my brother. 
                I enjoy programing and am excited to learn in this web development class!</p>

            <p>Hello! My name is Jordan Searle and I am from Plain City, Utah. I am a CNC Machinist for a company called Torq Manufacturing. 
                My goal is to become a Manufacturing Engineer. I enjoy spending my freetime either playing video games, making stuff on my 3D printer, or developing a personal video game with my brother. 
                I enjoy programing and am excited to learn in this web development class!</p>

            <p>I live in the state of Utah. I find the view of the mountains here to be quite stunning.
                The snow we get here make for wonderful skiing. Outside of winter, it gets nice and warm too. 
                One thing that we were famous for was the placing of the Golden Spike for the railroad which was where the tracks from one end of the country to the other were tied together.
                One more thing about Utah is that we have five national monuments.</p>
